This tool is intended to allow managing GitHub Contributor License Agreements.

= Setup

Below are the steps that are necessary to set this project up.

== Register a new OAuth application with GitHub

This application uses https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/[OAuth to access GitHub's APIs].
The first step is to https://github.com/settings/applications/new[Register a new OAuth application] with GitHub.

Example values for the form might be:

* *Application Name* - Pivotal CLA
* *Homepage URL* - https://pivotal.io
* *Application description* - Allows managing Contributor License Agreements for contributions to Pivotal sponsored projects
* *Authorization callback URL* - This needs to point back to your application's OAuth endpoint.
For development it might be http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/github
If you are needing to test receiving GitHub events, you will probably want to setup https://ngrok.com/#download[ngrok].
If you are using ngrok, the URL would look something like https://123456.ngrok.io/login/oauth2/github

After clicking *Register application* you should make the application aware of the *Client ID* and the *Client Secret*.

Create a new file named *application-local.properties*

.src/main/resources/application-local.properties
[source]
----
# Replace values from registered application at https://github.com/settings/developers
# See the README for additional detail
security.oauth2.main.clientId=Value from Client ID
security.oauth2.main.clientSecret=Value from Client Secret
----

== Register a personal access token

* Generate a https://github.com/settings/tokens/new[New personal access token] that contains only `public_repo` scope.
This will be used for adding comments to pull requests that require the contributor to sign the CLA.
* Copy the personal access token and place it in application-local.properties

Modify *application-local.properties*

.src/main/resources/application-local.properties
[source]
----
# Replace values from registered application at https://github.com/settings/developers
# See the README for additional detail
security.oauth2.main.clientId=Value from Client ID
security.oauth2.main.clientSecret=Value from Client Secret
security.oauth2.pivotal-cla.token-secret=A Personal Access Token with public_repo scope
----

== Setup ngrok

If you are needing to test receiving GitHub events, you will probably want to setup https://ngrok.com/#download[ngrok].
If there is no need to test receiving the GitHub events from GitHub, then you can skip this step.

= Running the Application

== Gradle

You can run the application using:

[source,bash]
----
$ ./gradlew bootRun
----

This mode enables the `local` profile which uses H2 for the in-memory database and Redis for storing sessions.
Redis *must* be started locally on port `6379`.

NOTE: To start a docker image for Redis and MySQL invoke `./ci/scripts/start-services.sh`.
The docker images can be shutdown using `./ci/scripts/stop-services.sh`.

=== Open the Application

You can open the application at a context root of "/".
If you are running, the default URL is at http://localhost:8080/

== Cloud Foundry

Deploying the application to Cloud Foundry can be performed using the https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/[Cloud Foundry CLI].
It is set up for TravisCI and manual deployment mode.

=== Required Properties

Deployment scripts for `pivotal-cla` require a set of properties to be deployed. Please keep in mind that secrets should not get published.

* `cfUsername`: Your username to log into Pivotal Cloud Foundry
* `cfPassword`: Your password to log into Pivotal Cloud Foundry
* `security.oauth2.main.clientId`: GitHub Client ID
* `security.oauth2.main.clientSecret`: GitHub Client Secret
* `security.oauth2.pivotal-cla.token-secret`: A Personal Access Token with public_repo scope
* For manual deployment only: `space`: Name of the space

=== Zero-downtime Deploys

Deployment is done with zero-downtime using a strategy similar to the https://github.com/contraband/autopilot[autopiolot plugin].
The application is deployed to multiple application names and if successful, the old application name is removed.


=== Manual Deployment with Cloud Foundry CLI

Manual deployment with https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/[Cloud Foundry CLI] can be done after https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/use-cli-plugins.html#plugin-install[installing it].

First log into Cloud Foundry.
For example:

[source,bash]
----
$ cf login -a api.run.pivotal.io -o pivotal-cla -s production -u $CF_USERNAME -p $CF_PASSWORD
----

Pushing to Cloud Foundry activates the `cloudfoundry` profile which requires a MySQL database and a Redis instance.
You can perform a zero-downtime deploy to Cloud Foundry using the included cf-push.sh script.
For example:

[source,bash]
----
$ ./ci/scripts/cf-push.sh pivotal-cla-production $CLIENT_ID $CLIENT_SECRET $TOKEN_SECRET $TRAVIS_BUILD_NUMBER-$TRAVIS_COMMIT
----


== Profiles

`pivotal-cla` uses two profiles to distinguish between running modes:

* `local` (enabled by default): Uses a H2 in-memory database
* `cloudfoundry`: Uses a MySQL database, Spring Session and Spring Data Redis. All connectors are obtained using Spring Cloud.
